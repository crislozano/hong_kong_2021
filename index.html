Thank you very much for being here today. 
This is the first time I present for an interpreting audience and I'm very interested in all the comments you might have.

By reading the title, predicting the end, you might be thinking about some sort of apocalyptic account. 
But prediction, far from being a complicated cognitive construct or a mystic power, is very much present in our daily lives. For example, when watching a movie,

you often find yourself trying to predict the end.

We also predict in other contexts of our lives. For example, when playing frisbee, we need to predict the trajectory of the frisbee in order to be able to catch it.

And, of course, you know that prediction or anticipation is one of the most important strategies when doing simultaneous interpreting. 
The joke says that it's a terrible idea to go to an interpreter's party becuase they never let you finish your sentence.

# Linguistic Prediction


## **Pre-activation** of stored linguistic information before it is available in the input.

--

## Important to understand: 


- ### which cues speakers exploit

- ### why processing is so fast and effective

- ### why L1 and L2 processing are different



---
class: inverse

# Goal



- ## Investigate prosodic cues for prediction in L1 and L2 Spanish

- ## Investigate whether processing morphology in the L2 is cognitively taxing

- ## Role of interpreting experience

### Non-predictive context 

- Morphological cues &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

e.g. "Encuentra la galleta" (Find the-FEM cookie)

- Morphosyntactic cues &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

???

In interpreting, we often focus on how the context gives us cues. However, research shows that, when the context is non-predictive, there are other cues that speakers use to predict upcoming information. For example, the gender instantiated in the determiner, allows the speaker to predict the object that will be mentioned (when only one of the displayed objects is feminine.) 

Something similar happens with case. When native German speakers hear the case in the article, they look to what's coming. In SVO, they look to the object, in OVS, they look to the subject

### Predictive context 

- Constraining sentences &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

e.g. "The day was breezy so the boy went outside to fly a/an kite/airplane"

- Semantic information from the verb &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

e.g. "The boy will eat/move the cake"


]

.footnote[

2. Atlmann &amp; Kamide, 1999
]

???

Other researchers have focused on what happens when the context of the sentence is constraining, this is closer to what we teach in interpreting courses. For example, when hearing the sentence "the day was breezy....", native speakers show a surprisal effect in the case of the less freqent noun (airplane), but importantly, this effect is shown already at the article. A group of labs failed to replicate this effect, but we can discuss at the end if your interested.

Other examples of predictive context would be sentences where the semantic information in the verb helps to predict what comes next. For instance, when presented with this image and hears the sentence They boy will eat the cake, the participant is already looking at the cake right after hearing the verb eat.

What happens with L2 learners?

After calibration, the participant saw a fixation cross for 250ms, followed by 1000ms of the two possible words (as it is standard in visual world paradigm experiments), and then they listened to a sentence containing one of the two words.

# Statistical Analyses

### Growth Curve Analysis 
  
  - Determine whether participants can anticipate
  - Evaluate group differences

### Fixed effects:

  - group
  - lexical stress
  - syllable structure 

### Random effects:

  - subject (random slope: syllable structure and lexical stress)
  - item

???

We analyzed the time window spanning from 200ms before the target syllabe offset, until 600ms after. 

The GCA is a model that fits that data to its functional form. We included the linear, quadratic and cubic time terms.

???

In this graph we are looking at the probability of fixations towards the target averaging across all conditions 200ms after the offset of the target syllable (it takes 200ms for the eye to move after having heard a particular stimulus). So just one specific time point (the intercept of our model). On the Y axis we have probability of fixations, the thick white line indicate chance. On the x axis we have the 3 groups. The blue points are paroxytone conditions (firma and papa), red oxytones (firmó and papá). Circles are targets without a coda, triangles are targets with a coda. 

In the morphological ending experiment, we see that monolinguals can predict the ending above chance for all conditions, although CV paroxytones seem to yield a lower rate of fixations. The non-interpreters and interpreters show a similar pattern, they seem to predict at a lower rate, but they don't do it above chance for CV parox.

In the non-morphological ending experiment. Monolinguals show almost the same pattern. But we see differences between interpreters and non-interpreters. The non-interpreters can only anticipate above chance in the CVC oxytone conditions, whereas interpreters predict above chance for all conditions, the seem to do so at a lower rate with the CV condition and the paroxytone condition.

???
In the previous graph we were seeing what happens at the intercept (point at it in the graph). In this graph we're seeing the model estimates for the time window from 200ms before the offset of the target syllable, until 600ms after.

On the top panes we have conditions without the coda, for parox and oxy, bottom conditions with coda. We see that overall, monolinguals anticipate earlier (the curve crosses change eairlier in the time course) and at a higher rate (by the offset of the target syllable, the curve is higher). 

In the case of Experiment 1, we see that interpreters and non-interpreters behave similarly, interpreters seem to anticipate later in the time course, they are doing it faster because the reach the same rate of anticipation by the offset of the target syllable.

Moving to Experiment 2, we see differences between the interpreters and non-interpreters. The interpreters are behaving closer to monolinguals. The group effect did not reach significance when comparing mon to in accross conditions, however it was .057. The non-morphological ending seems to be harder to anticipate for the non-interpreters and, as we saw earlier, they are only anticipating in the CVC-oxytonce condition.

- Syllabic structure: coda increases prediction
- Stress: oxy fixated earlier than parox


**NIN**

- Anticipate later than NIN, but faster

**NIN**
- Anticipate less than MON

I started by a descriptive explanation of what's going on, here is a summary of the effects and interactions that we got from the growth curve analysis.

# Discussion

.large[
- Monolinguals use stress and syllabic structure in a similar way for predicting both morphological and non-morphological word endings 

- Experience with interpreting doesn't seem to have a big impact on the prediction of morphology

- But it does make a difference when predicting non-morphological endings

- Both lexical stress and syllabic structure behave in the same direction
    - Less frequent conditions (oxytone, CVC) improve prediction
    - Having fewer lexical competitors accelerates prediction
]

---

# Conclusions

.large[

2. Prediction strategies are qualitatively similar in the L1 and L2, but quantitatively different.

1. Interpreting enhances prediction strategies in the bilingual mind.

# Limitations and future studies
.large[
- **Other reasons why interpreters are better**:
    - increased weekly contact with the L2, 
    - stronger resistance to articulatory suppression
    - better effort coordination
]

--
.large[
- **Future studies**:
    - Investigate the role of interpreting experience in prediction based on contextual information
    - How does informal interpreting experience impact language processing and prediction? (child language brokers)
    - In what ways could we improve pedagogical practices of interpreting by including prediction training?
